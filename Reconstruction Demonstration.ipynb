    "By using B-scans obtained during an US scan with positional data obtained through an IMU, the structure of interest can be reconstructed to provide either a 3D model or a 2D image with a wider field of view. This notebook demonstrates the use of such a reconstruction to map the knee joint space in an effort to more accessibly and reliably visualize predictors of knee osteoarthritis in a pre-clinical setting."
